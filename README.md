This repository contains the code for
"Closed-Loop Concave Configurations and Concave Quadratic Regulator ".

Reminder:
The simulations contain two cases

%% case 1
First, we need to run the file `case1.m` in 'paramenter' to set up the necesseary parameters for the simulation. Then, one can use `Case1simulink.slx` to obtain all the results proposed in this paper. 

%% case 2
First, we need to run the file `case2.m` in 'paramenter' to set up the necesseary parameters for the simulation. Then, one can use `Case2simulink.slx` to obtain all the results proposed in this paper. 

All simulation files are available in the Directory of 'Matlab files'.

The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:

Windows 11 22H2
Matlab 2022b
